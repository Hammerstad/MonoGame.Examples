# MonoGame Examples

This repository contains a set of personal examples using MonoGame. The `MGEx.Common` contains components used across several projects, like `OrbitCamera`, `VertexPositionColorNormal` and `Cube`. Each other project contains a `README.md` file explaining that particular example.

## List of examples (more to come)

- [**Basic effect**](MGEx.BasicEffect) - simple example of rendering a cube using a basic effect (toggles on/off).
- [**Basic Model**](MGEx.BasicModel) - simple example of rendering a 3d model with an orbiting camera.
